# cntlm
An NTLM, NTLM2SR, and NTLMv2 authenticating HTTP proxy
Source was taken from cntlm.sourceforge.com. There have been no updates in several years, and given the actions of souceforge of late it seemed prudent to move it away. I uploaded the source with the addtion of a systemd service file, and a PKGBUILD for use with makepkg on arch linux. This will also be available on the AUR
